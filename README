 
We will try to simplify the problem as much as possible. Please find User Stories below. Let’s 
assume that there is only one organization in the application, all users belong to it. 


● As a user, when I choose items from menu, I can only choose one item from the first 
course, one item from the main course and one drink. Total 3 items. 

● As a user I can press Submit button to process my order. 


● As a Lunches Admin, I can browse days and see users’ orders there. 
 

● As a Lunches Admin, on the date page I can see the list of orders and total launch cost 
for today.  
 
Let’s assume that instead of calling to the Launches Delivery Company, they have a smart ERP 
which can request the order for today through our API at a specific time.  
 ●
●
As a system, I should be able to provide list of the orders for today with details for each 
person through RESTful JSON API endpoint. 
As a system, I should have a secure API. 
General Notes
● Keep your code clean.  
● Thin controllers, fat models. Don’t forget about validations 
● Prefer quality to the speed of delivering this task 
● The code should be covered with unit, functional and integration tests. (Please use 
RSpec+Capybara) 
● Front­end can be pretty very simple. 
○ The source code of application should be uploaded on github.com and deployed to 
heroku in the end. 
○ Connect Travis­CI to your public repository
